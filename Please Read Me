Contents of my Github/Portfolio:

1. RusherAi (C#, AI for an enemy type in my video game. Uses logic checks to determine what the enemy should be doing)
2. battleship (Python, a Battleship game that I completed as a final project for a class. This uses data structures like arrays, randomization, and infinite loops)

NOTE:

Some of my projects have not been include, such as my Command Line Shell or my Task Manager app. There are some reasons for this:

a. Official academic policy prohibits me from sharing these on GitHub (I am still allowed to show you these if you ask me)
b. I no longer have access to said project

If the case is (a), then contact me. I will be happy to show you what I have!
